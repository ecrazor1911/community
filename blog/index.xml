My Percona XtraDB Cluster version: 5.7.31-31. Single Node is stuck in a joined state.
I recently had the privilege to help a client with a fascinating issue.
NODE-B dropped out of the 3 node PXC cluster. It looked to be DISK IO that caused NODE-B to fall far behind and eventually be removed from the cluster. A restart of NODE-B allowed it to rejoin the cluster. NODE-B looked to have been down for about 4 hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
